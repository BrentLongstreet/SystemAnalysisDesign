# SystemAnalysisDesign

# Summary

The purpose of this project is to build a system that will help drivers pass their driving tests. The client is Liam, the owner of DriverPass. They want their system to help organize and manage their business transactions. Liam wants to help students pass their driverâ€™s test by having online practice tests and classes. Additionally, he wants to allow the students to select a package option that will provide them with in-person driving practice with an instructor. 

# Pros and cons of my design

I mainly did well at providing optimal solutions that addressed each of the owner's wants and concerns. I developed a system that fit the business's needs and made choices that will allow the company still to utilize the system with increased traffic in the future. If I were to choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, it would be the Gannt chart in the business requirements document. After working with Lucidcharts more, I am now able to correctly label the months/days so it better represents the time frame in which the work was completed. This revision will fix the Gannt chart and accurately display the dates the work is scheduled to be worked on. 

# User's needs

I interpret the user's needs and implement them into my system design by valuing the pros and cons of each implementation and selecting the option that will be the most optimal for the situation. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a system because they experience the system first-hand and interact with the implementations. Providing a seamless and valuable experience for the user will result in a higher retention rate and the system will continue being used.

# Software design approach

I approach designing software by first understanding the problem. I will break the problem down and simplify the processes necessary to develop a solution. I value the pros and cons of each implementation and decide on the importance of each factor. A simplified version of the system will then be created to ensure its functionality. Testing will be conducted, and a version of the system will be deployed after testing. To analyze and design a system in the future, I will continue to use my deconstruction method first. Understanding the problem and implementations needed to develop a solution is a vital first step. Simplifying the problem, and designing a simplified solution ensures the system is functional first.
